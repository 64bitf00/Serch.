# Serch.
Serch. let's you search directories on Google for whatever you want!
# How does Serch. work?
Serch. uses Google dorks to find directories that have listed the file you want to download. It passes your query to a javascript which further queries Google for it in a new tab.
# Installation
This is a simple HTML page which can run completely client sided. That is, you don't need any server of any kind. Just an internet connection to load the CSS files from a CDN and to open Google.
# Instructions for usage
Just download this package as a .zip, open the index.html in any browser and put in your query in the search bar. Select the type of file you want to search from the dropdown menu present on the left of the search bar. You can choose from various extensions of different kinds like videos, eBooks, compressed files, android apps etc.
